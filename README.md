Explore Yelp Dataset

The contents of this repository were used to conduct exploratory data analysis on the Yelp dataset provided: https://www.yelp.com/dataset 
In this repository, there are 2 notebooks, one containing a segment of data cleaning and preprocessing tasks and another to conduct methods of topic modeling/predictive modeling on the datasets.

From the yelp dataset, the business, user and review files were used for this project. 

1. [Data Cleaning](https://github.com/kellychoy/YelpReview-Ratings/blob/main/data_cleaning.ipynb)
   This notebook explains the steps to clean the dataset and condense the data to only restaurants in California. The overall dataset was ~8.8GB so runtime did take a while but this step is important for efficiency for the remaining steps of the project. Filter the business file to California only and remove unimportant columns ([see overview pg 6](https://github.com/kellychoy/YelpReview-Ratings/blob/main/YelpReview-Ratings%20Overview.pdf)https://github.com/kellychoy/YelpReview-Ratings/blob/main/YelpReview-Ratings%20Overview.pdf))
